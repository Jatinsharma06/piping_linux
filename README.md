How to retrieve data using piping..
Piping in computer science refers to a technique used to pass the output of one command, program, or process directly as input to another. It is widely used in Unix-like operating systems and is a fundamental concept in command-line interfaces and shell scripting.

# Key Points:
1. **Symbol**: The pipe is represented by the `|` character.
2. **Functionality**: It enables chaining of commands, allowing data to flow between them in a sequence.
   - Example: `ls | grep .txt` lists only `.txt` files by passing the output of `ls` to `grep`.
3. **Efficiency**: Piping avoids the need for intermediate files, as data is streamed directly between commands.
4. **Common Use Cases**:
   - Filtering output: `cat file.txt | grep "keyword"`
   - Counting results: `ls | wc -l`
   - Combining tools: `ps aux | grep python | sort -nrk 3`
5. **Applications**:
   - Automation in scripts.
   - Processing large datasets.
   - Building complex workflows in DevOps and system administration.
